SJPCAP 0.2 README

Popular java-based packet capture (pcap) libraries implement parts of their
functionality using libpcap over JNI. For those that require nothing more
than support for parsing pcap files, these libraries introduce unnecessary
complexity and potential OS compatibility issues.

The sjpcap library is a native alternative that parses libpcap-created packet
capture files to create simplified, java-based object representations of
IPv4-based IP, UDP and TCP packets.
